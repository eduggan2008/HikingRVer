				<p>In April 2017 I finally made the move to living as a full time RVer.  That basically means my RV is my home on wheels.  I am free to travel as much or as little as I desire.  This means that I now have the time to pursue my love of hiking at a much greater level.</p>
				
				<p>I may move around on a weekly basis, or I may find a spot for months at a time.  I love finding free campsites to disperse camp (boondock).  By a river or lake, in the mountains or desert, on public lands wherever it is allowed.  Anywhere I can find some hiking in the area, or just to explore the vastly different areas of this country.</p>
				
				<p>There are times I will find either work or volunteer opportunities, staying for months at a time.  This allows me the opportunity to earn some extra income, or to settle down in one area for a longer period of time, in order to have more time to explore.</p>

				<p>I remember meeting a couple in San Diego about 40 years ago, when I was about 20 years old. They were telling me and my friends about their travels around the world in a Winnebago. I loved hearing about their journeys. I told myself that someday I am going to live in an RV full-time and travel. Now, that dream is a reality!</p>
				
				<p>While hiking is physically challenging, it is also highly rewarding.  It doesn't matter if you are hiking easy trails or if you are taking on challenging terrain, there is hiking opportunities for everyone at every skill level.  The rewards are many.  To name a few: Exercise is good for your health, getting back to nature is refreshing, and you will meet so many interesting people on the trails. I love hiking for those reasons, and many more.</p>
				
				<p>I hope I can inspire you to get outdoors, go rving or camping, travel to new areas, go for walks or hikes, find peace that comes from getting away from the normal, busy lives we all experience daily, and just get out and live life!  I hope you enjoy my website.  I designed it to share some of my experiences hiking and RVing.</p>

				<p>I recently wanted to learn how to build websites.  I have been learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This website was designed by me from scratch. I hope you enjoy the website! I have enjoyed building it!</p>

				<p>I have a passion about the stock market. It fascinates me. I would love to become a day trader someday! I admit that I don't spend enough time pursuing this passion. One day though! </p>

				<p>In 2019, I finally took the time to hike the northern half of the Appalachian Trail.  It was an incredible experience, physically and mentally challenging, yet incredibly rewarding!  I met so many incredible people along the trail.  I also earned my trail name, "Boondocker".  I hiked 1167 miles, from Harpers Ferry, West Virginia to Mt Katahdin, Maine.  I plan to finish the southern half of the trail, hopefully in the near future.</p>

				<p>Sadly, as I am writing this, coronavirus has been wreaking havok on the world, and everybody's future is unclear.  I truly hope this pandemic is short lived and we all can find a way to heal and get back to some form of a normal life again.  Be safe everyone!</p>
