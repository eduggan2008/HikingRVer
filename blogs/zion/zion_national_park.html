                <h2>Zion National Park</h2>
            </figcaption>

                <p>In January, 2020, I took a road trip with my daughter Mindy to some of the national parks in Utah and Arizona.  One of the parks we visited was Zion National Park in Utah.  We drove from Bryce Canyon National Park over to Mt Carmel Junction to stay at an RV park for 2 nights.</p>
                <p>On January 11th we spent the day checking out Zion.  With only one day, we tried to see as much of the park as possible, while getting a couple small hikes in.   The drive into the park along Rte 9 is beautiful.  It gives a glimpse of what the park has to offer.  The changing landscape has incredible shades of red, brown, tan, and off white color.  Rock formations and hills/cliffs are everywhere.</p>
                <p>Our first stop was a hike on the Zion Canyon Overlook Trail.  The trail is easy, about a mile round trip, gaining only 442' in elevation.  This is the perfect trail to really get your first incredible view into Zion.  The trail starts with a set of stone stairs.  The trail winds along the cliff walls, over sand and stone, over wooden boardwalks, under cliff overhangs, and looks up on both sides of the canyon cliff walls, and looks down into the depths of a steep canyon.  When you reach the end of the trail, you have an incredible view of Zion Canyon.  The canyon walls rise above you on your left and right.  The sheer cliff dropoff directly in front of you is awe inspiring!  You can see the Mt Carmel Tunnel windows in the cliff walls to your left.  The Mt Carmel road exits the tunnel down below, and switchbacks down to the lower canyon.  This is an incredibly rewarding view for such an easy trail.</p>
                <p>After that hike, we drove through the tunnel, which has some large windows cut out of the walls, which give a cool, quick look out into the Zion canyon.  After following the switchbacks down the canyon, we turned right onto the road that brings you into the ever narrowing canyon.  The canyon walls rise thousands of feet above you on both sides.  This road is typically closed to personal vehicles, due to limited parking and no easy way to turn around.  It's typically only open to driving in January and February.  There are shuttles that transport the tourists into this part of the canyon.</p>
                <p>We stopped at all the tourist stops along the route.  Taking short walks and lots of pictures.  We saw a lot of hikers going up the Angels Landing trail, which is probably the most popular hike at Zion.  We spent some time exploring the Virgin river, which flows through the canyon.  We saw a lot considering we only had one day in the park.</p>
                <p>We went in Springdale for lunch.  Springdale is the town at the entrance to Zion on the south side of the canyon.  It's a busy little town, with lots of options for tourists.  Restaurants, hotels, gift shops, camping, and so much more.  We stopped for luch at a place called Cafe Soleil.  Delicious sandwiches!  I would definitely recomend this spot.</p>
                <p>So, I hope you enjoy some of the photos taken at Zion National Park.  This is really a beautiful place to visit.  I can't wait until I can come back and spend a couple weeks hiking all over this park.</p>
